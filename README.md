## Hi there I'm Mayuri 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on **React Native** projects focused on cross-platform mobile app development.  

🌱 I’m currently learning Google Cloud Computing and exploring AI/ML to enhance my app development skills.  

👯 I’m looking to collaborate with fellow mobile developers on exciting and impactful projects.  

🤔 I’m looking for help with **integrating advanced ML models into mobile apps and deploying scalable cloud-based backends**.  

💬 Ask me about Flutter, React Native, Android development (Java/Kotlin), Firebase, or mobile UI/UX best practices.
