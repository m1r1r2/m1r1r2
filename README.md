## Hi there I'm Mayuri ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **React Native** projects focused on cross-platform mobile app development.  

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Google Cloud Computing and exploring AI/ML to enhance my app development skills.  

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with fellow mobile developers on exciting and impactful projects.  

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **integrating advanced ML models into mobile apps and deploying scalable cloud-based backends**.  

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Flutter, React Native, Android development (Java/Kotlin), Firebase, or mobile UI/UX best practices.
